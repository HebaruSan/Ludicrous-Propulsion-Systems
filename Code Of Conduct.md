# Ludicrous Propulsion Systems Code of Conduct
If you feel like you will be discriminated against for any physical, sexual, or mental state you are in, do not mention it. No one will know, and no one will be able to say anything. 
If you feel like you have been harassed in any way, please contact me on the KSP Forums by sending a Personal Message to 'Benjamin Kerman' or send my an email at 'bcronin720@gmail.com'
I prefer a message on the forums, but either method works. 
I (Benjamin Cronin) promise to do all that is in my power to create a welcoming environment for all people.
