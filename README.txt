Welcome to LPS and thanks for downloading! 

To install this mod, place ModuleManager and the LPS folder inside the GameData folder next to the Squad folder. 

This mod redistributes Module Manager and Addon Version Checker, along with several stock models and textures. 
AT THIS MOMENT, I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE MODELS OR TEXTURES THIS MOD DISTRIBUTES. 

This mod also does not have a license, but please be nice with it. Feel free to redistribute it, but don't claim it as your own. 
I have put many hours of work into this, and I hope that you will respect it. 

Please report any bugs on my GitHub page at www.github.com/BenjaminCronin/Ludicrous-Propulsion-Systems

Thank you!
