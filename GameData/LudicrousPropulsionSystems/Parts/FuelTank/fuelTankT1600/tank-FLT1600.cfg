	description = When the staff of Benjamin Kerman's Welding Supply Co discovered that they could sell two FL-T800 fuel tanks for the price of one that was twice as long, they were all over it. Using company supplies, they quickly devised a new fuel tank holding twice the fuel as the competitor, with none of those happy stripes.
